Chess+  
-
Starts as regular chess against a bot,  
but the pieces and the board can be upgraded!    


Pawn Upgrades:  
-
+ **Space +** (increased movement range)  
+ **Capture +** (capture pieces directly ahead or beside of you)  
+ **Movement +** (move backward!)  
  
  
Rook Upgrades:
-
+ **Inside Battalion** (house up to 3 other pieces inside, each piece reduces movement by 2)  
+ **Horsin' Around** (You may turn along your movement once, mimicing the Knight's movement pattern)  

  
Knight Upgrades:
-
+ **Knightly Duty** (If in Check, you may move trice)  
+ **Hasty Retreat** (If this Knight is captured but moved last turn, instead of being captured it retreats back to the square it was on before.)  
+ **Rescue Party**  (This Knight can swap places with another friendly piece, of your choice. This move cannot be used to escape check.)
  
  
Bishop Upgrades:  
-
+ **Bishop of Spiders** (add the Rook's movement to your own, making a web shaped movement pattern)  
+ **Bishop of Horses** (you may turn during your movement once, but you must remain diagonal)  
+ **Bishop of the Holy See** (you may perform Il Vaticano on any pieces on the board)
+ **Bishop of the Crusade** (you may capture any pieces in your path, but if you capture more than one, this piece is captured at the end of movement)  
  
Queen Upgrades:
-
+ **The Queen Winks** (This Queen may move to any available space on the board, but cannot capture pieces to do it)
+ **Force Majure** (This Queen may overpower an enemy piece close to her and force them to move away, this costs them their next move)
  
King Upgrades:  
-
+ **Off with Her Head!** (Capture your own Queen, gain her movement)  
+ **Force Majure** (This King may overpower an enemy piece close to her and force them to move away, this costs them their next move)
